# Forecasting the Sales for Rossmann Stores

This repository is a project of machine learning to predict sales from different stores, serving for studying purposes.

The goal of this project is to simulate a real world problem, and train the abilities that are necessary for a data scientist.

The problem, method and solution were proposed by Meigarom Lopes, in his digital course: "Data Science em Produção" - https://www.hotmart.com/product/data-science-em-producao/Y24207977W.

The data used is available at Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales/data.
